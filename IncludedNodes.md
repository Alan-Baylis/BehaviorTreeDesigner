  > Logs the content of the selected Blackboard Entry.

## Decorators

## Actions
* SetEntry:

* HasEntry:
  > Returns SUCCESS if Entry matches the Value, FAILURE if not.  
    Class entries can only match to "not null".

* TagToEntry:
  > Finds the closest Transform with the selected Tag and returns SUCCESS, if no  
    Transform was found it returns FAILURE.

* LayerToEntry:
  > Finds the closest Transform with the selected Layer and returns SUCCESS, if no  
    Transform was found it returns FAILURE.

* TriggerToEntry:
  > When the named GameObject triggers the collider, the parent objects Transform is  
    set as the Entry. NOTE: This requires a child GameObject to be set up, with a
