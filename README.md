### BehaviorTreeDesigner
An asset to help you design great ai.  
Requires Unity 5.4 or higher.  
Made possible thanks to the awesome [Node_Editor](https://github.com/Baste-RainGames/Node_Editor) by Baste-RainGames, thank you : )

## Getting Started

* Add this repository to your projects Assets folder.
* In Unity, go to Window->Node Editor to open the Behavior Tree Editor.
* In the Tree editor, click "New Canvas" and select "Behavior Canvas".
* Now you can create behaviors by clicking right mouse button and placing nodes.
* NOTE: You must have a "Root" and no connected nodes with a single output can have it empty.
* Save the Behavior tree using the "Save Canvas As" button.
* Add a empty GameObject to the scene and add a "Behavior Manager" script to it.
* Add the behavior tree reference and the agent reference and hit Play.
